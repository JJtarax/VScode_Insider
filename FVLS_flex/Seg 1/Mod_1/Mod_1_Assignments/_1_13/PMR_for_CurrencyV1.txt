PMR:
<+s>: What I have gained is what style that i like to use when programming.
The style that i prefer is the one that was used in the souvenir purchases section where all the code that was used for souvenir #1 was grouped to together 
unlike in the Conversion section of the program. In the Conversion section of the program they grouped it by functionality.

<-s>: I had a logic error where the dollarsAfter(country name) would be a negative. I fixed it by reducing the values of the money spent in each country.
--------------
In the future: Use the format that was used in the souvenir section of the program to help avoid future logic errors.
