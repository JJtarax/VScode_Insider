<+s>: 	Got to do Casting and if/else statements

<-s>:   I tried to put the varables in the If loop and it didn't work so I defined the varables outside then used them inside
        
--------------
In the future: I will know how to use if and else statementsand i will know to define a varable outside instead of defining it inside a loop
