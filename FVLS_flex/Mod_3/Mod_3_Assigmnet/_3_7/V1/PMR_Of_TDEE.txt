PMR:
<+s>: 	Learned that you can use a if/else statment within a if/else statment

<-s>: 	It took me awhile to figure out that you can't define a varable within a if statment
--------------
In the future: I will know to define a varble outside of the if/else statements and be able to make if/else staements within if/else staeement
